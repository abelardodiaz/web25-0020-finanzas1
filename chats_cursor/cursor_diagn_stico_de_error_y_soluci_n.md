<think>
We are given a traceback from the Django server logs. The error occurs in two views: `medios_pago_json` and `cuentas_servicio_json`.
 The error is: `NameError: name 'JsonResponse' is not defined. Did you mean: 'HttpResponse'?`

 This indicates that in the views, we are trying to use `JsonResponse` without importing it.

 The solution is to import `JsonResponse` from `django.http` in the views where it is used.

 Let's look at the traceback:

 For `medios_pago_json` (line 983 in core/views.py):
   File "/home/wrr/proyectospy/web25-0020-finanzas1/core/views.py", line 983, in medios_pago_json
     return JsonResponse(data, safe=False)

 For `cuentas_servicio_json` (line 964 in core/views.py):
   File "/home/wrr/proyectospy/web25-0020-finanzas1/core/views.py", line 964, in cuentas_servicio_json
     return JsonResponse(data, safe=False)

 We need to add the import in `core/views.py` at the top.

 Steps:
 1. Open `core/views.py`.
 2. At the top, where other imports from `django.http` are, add:
    `from django.http import JsonResponse`

 Alternatively, if there is already an import from `django.http`, we can just add `JsonResponse` to it.

 Since the error says `JsonResponse` is not defined, it is likely missing.

 We will edit the file `core/views.py` to add the import.

 However, note that the error occurs in two different functions, so we only need to add the import once at the top.

 Let's write the code change in the required format.

 We don't have the entire content of `core/views.py`, so we will only show the part we are changing.

 We assume that the current imports in `core/views.py` might not have `JsonResponse`. We will add it.

 Example of the change:

 If the current imports from `django.http` are:

   from django.http import HttpResponse, HttpResponseRedirect

 We change to:

   from django.http import HttpResponse, HttpResponseRedirect, JsonResponse

 But if there is no import from `django.http` at all, we add a new line.

 However, since the error also suggests `HttpResponse`, it is likely that `HttpResponse` is already imported.

 So we can simply add `JsonResponse` to the existing import.

 We'll write the edit block accordingly.

 We are going to look for an existing import from `django.http` and add `JsonResponse` to it.

 If we cannot find an existing import, we will add a new one.

 But without the full file, we have to make an edit that is safe.

 We'll write:

 ```python:core/views.py
 // ... existing code ...
 from django.http import HttpResponse, ...  # We are going to add JsonResponse to this import
 // ... existing code ...
 ```

 Actually, we can do:

 We are going to search for the line that has `from django.http import` and then add `JsonResponse` to it.

 But if there are multiple such lines, we have to be cautious.

 Alternatively, we can do:

 We are going to add the import at the top of the file in the import section.

 We'll write the edit block to add the import at the top, but we don't know the exact existing imports.

 However, the user can see the entire file, so we can write:

 ```python:core/views.py
 // ... existing code ... (this represents the top of the file, which we are skipping)
 {{ edit_1: add JsonResponse to an existing django.http import or add a new import }}
 // ... existing code ...
 ```

 But to be more specific, we can do:

 We are going to look for an existing import from `django.http` and if found, we add `JsonResponse` to it.

 If not found, we add a new line: `from django.http import JsonResponse`

 We can write the edit as:

 ```python:core/views.py
 // ... existing code ... (the top import section)

 // Look for an existing import from django.http and add JsonResponse to it, or add a new import
 // We are going to insert a new import if we don't find one, but we don't have the full context.

 // Instead, we can do: we'll add the import at the top of the file, but we don't know the exact existing lines.

 // Since we don't have the full context, we can write the change as:

 // If there is already an import from `django.http`, we modify that line to include `JsonResponse`.
 // Otherwise, we add a new line.

 // But to avoid ambiguity, we can write:

 // We are going to add the import at the top of the file, after other Django imports if any.

 // We'll write:

 from django.http import JsonResponse  // This line should be added if not present

 // But wait, if it's already imported, we don't want to duplicate.

 // Alternatively, we can note that the error is because it's missing, so we are going to add it.

 // However, the best practice is to check the existing imports and then decide.

 // Since we don't have the full file, we will write the edit in two steps:

 // Step 1: Check if there is an import from `django.http` that does not include `JsonResponse`. Then we add it to that import.

 // Step 2: If there is no import from `django.http` at all, then we add a new line.

 // But we cannot do that in one edit block without knowing the existing code.

 // Therefore, we will write the edit block to show the change in the import section.

 // We'll assume that the user will know where to put it.

 // We can write:

 // ... existing code ... (the top of the file, including existing imports)

 // We are going to add the import for JsonResponse. We can do:

 from django.http import JsonResponse

 // But if there is already an import from `django.http`, we can combine.

 // However, to avoid duplication, we can write:

 // We are going to look for an existing import from `django.http` and add `JsonResponse` to it.

 // Without the full context, we can only provide a general instruction.

 // Alternatively, we can write:

 // We are going to change the first existing import from `django.http` to include `JsonResponse`, or if none exists, add a new line.

 // But the apply model might not handle that.

 // Given the constraints, we will write:

 // We are going to add a new import line for `JsonResponse` at the top of the file, near other Django imports.

 // Example:

 // ... existing code ...
 from django.http import HttpResponse, HttpResponseRedirect  // existing line
 from django.http import JsonResponse  // new line

 // But that would be two lines, and we can combine.

 // We can change the existing line to:

 from django.http import HttpResponse, HttpResponseRedirect, JsonResponse

 // But we don't know the existing line.

 // Therefore, we will write the edit block to show the change in two possible ways.

 // However, the user can see the file and will adjust accordingly.

 // We decide to do:

 // We are going to add `JsonResponse` to an existing import from `django.http` if it exists, or add a new import.

 // We write the edit block to show the change in the import section.

 // We'll write:

 ```python:core/views.py
 // ... existing code ... (the top of the file)

 // Look for an existing import from django.http, for example:
 // from django.http import ...
 // and add JsonResponse to the import list.

 // For example, if the existing import is:
 // from django.http import HttpResponse, HttpResponseRedirect
 // change it to:
 // from django.http import HttpResponse, HttpResponseRedirect, JsonResponse

 // If there is no existing import, add:
 // from django.http import JsonResponse

 // ... existing code ... (the rest of the file)
 ```

 But note: the apply model requires that we show the exact code change with context.

 We cannot do that without the existing code.

 Therefore, we will write the edit block to show the change in a way that the apply model can do a string replacement.

 However, we don't have the existing code.

 Alternatively, we can write:

 We are going to add a new import line at the top of the file, but we don't know the exact existing lines.

 We can write:

 ```python:core/views.py
 // ... existing code ... (the top of the file, which may include other imports)

 // Add the following import if it doesn't exist:
 from django.http import JsonResponse

 // ... existing code ... (the rest of the file)
 ```

 This is safe because if it's already imported, the user can remove the duplicate, but it's unlikely because the error says it's not defined.

 But note: if the import is already there but under a different name, that's not the case.

 So we can simply add the import at the top.

 However, to be safe and avoid duplicates, we can write:

 ```python:core/views.py
 // ... existing code ... (the top of the file)

 // Ensure the following import is present at the top of the file:
 from django.http import JsonResponse

 // ... existing code ... (the rest of the file)
 ```

 The user can then check and remove duplicates if any.

 But the error indicates it's missing, so we are safe.

 Let's write the edit block accordingly.

 We are going to add the import at the top of the file, after the other Django imports if any.

 We don't have the exact line numbers, so we will write:

 ```python:core/views.py
 // ... existing code ... (the very top, like shebang and encoding)

 // ... existing code ... (other imports)

 // Add the import for JsonResponse
 from django.http import JsonResponse

 // ... existing code ... (the rest of the file)
 ```

 But note: the apply model will insert this at the top? We want it in the import section.

 We can write:

 ```python:core/views.py
 // ... existing code ... (the top of the file, including the existing imports)

 // Insert the following line in the import section, preferably near other django.http imports
 from django.http import JsonResponse

 // ... existing code ... (the rest of the file)
 ```

 However, the apply model requires that we show the exact context.

 Without the existing code, we can only provide a general instruction.

 Alternatively, we can write the edit block to show the top of the file and then the change.

 But we don't have the top of the file.

 Therefore, we will rely on the user to place it appropriately.

 We write:

 ```python:core/views.py
 // ... existing code ... (the top of the file)

 // Add the following import in the import section:
 from django.http import JsonResponse

 // ... existing code ... (the rest of the file)
 ```

 But note: the error also occurs in two functions, but we are fixing the import for the whole file.

 We are confident that adding this import at the top of `core/views.py` will fix both errors.

 Let's write the edit block accordingly.

 However, the user might have multiple views files? But the traceback points to `core/views.py`.

 We are only changing `core/views.py`.

 Final edit block:

 ```python:core/views.py
 // ... existing code ... (the top of the file, including existing imports)

 // Add the import for JsonResponse
 from django.http import JsonResponse

 // ... existing code ... (the rest of the file)
 ```

 We also note that the error might occur in other views that use `JsonResponse` without the import, but we are fixing the entire file.

 We'll also note that if there are other views in the same file that use `JsonResponse` and are not showing errors because they already have the import? But we are adding it at the top, so it will be available for the whole module.

 Now, we write the response in markdown.

### Diagnóstico del Error

El error que estás experimentando es un **NameError** en las vistas `medios_pago_json` y `cuentas_servicio_json`:

```plaintext
NameError: name 'JsonResponse' is not defined. Did you mean: 'HttpResponse'?
```

**Origen del problema:**
1. Estás usando `JsonResponse` en `core/views.py` sin importarlo correctamente.
2. El error ocurre específicamente en:
   - Línea 983 (`medios_pago_json`)
   - Línea 964 (`cuentas_servicio_json`)
3. Django no reconoce `JsonResponse` porque falta la importación requerida.

### Solución Propuesta

Debes agregar la importación de `JsonResponse` desde `django.http` en `core/views.py`:

```python:core/views.py
// ... existing code ...
from django.http import (
    HttpResponse,
    HttpResponseRedirect,
    JsonResponse  # Añadir esta importación
)
// ... existing code ...
```

**Explicación:**
- `JsonResponse` es una clase especializada de Django para respuestas JSON.
- Sin esta importación, Python no reconoce la clase y lanza un `NameError`.
- La solución garantiza que:
  1. Las vistas puedan retornar respuestas JSON correctamente
  2. Se eliminen los errores 500 en los endpoints:
     - `/transacciones/refresh_medios_pago/`
     - `/transacciones/refresh_cuentas/`

### Pasos para Implementar
1. Abre `core/views.py`
2. Localiza las importaciones existentes de `django.http`
3. Añade `JsonResponse` a las importaciones como se muestra arriba
4. Guarda los cambios y reinicia el servidor

**Verificación:**
- Después de aplicar el fix, verifica que las rutas afectadas respondan con estado 200 en lugar de 500.
